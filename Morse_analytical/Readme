Morse_Nanohub

It is the most Primitve Example of Numerov package. It can be used to give vibrational information of both ground and excited states of 
H2 and H2+ and optionally Franck-Condon factors can also be calculated.

In this demo, we used Morse Potential of H2 diatomic system (ground/excited H2+) to calculate vibrational energy levels etc.
Please visit : https://nanohub.org/tools/morsepotential for Jupyter notebook/supplementary informations (eg. to evaluate Morse Parameters etc.).

Steps:
1. run GroundNumerov_v1.py
2. Change Parameters.py file and,
3. run ExcitedNumerov_v1.py
4 run FCparameter.py
5. from the log of FCparameter make PES.dat and plot it by PlotPES.py file.
